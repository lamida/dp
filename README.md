# Dynamic Programming For Beginners

Solutions to the problems from the course: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClnwNEngsXoIp_tgJ2jZWfw

# Lecture 1 Notes
Introduction

# Lecture 2 Notes
## Dynamic Programming Properties
* Optimal Substructure
* Overlapping subproblems

### Optimal Substructure
To solve a structure we can leverage the substructure.

### Overlapping Subproblems
Easy example is fibonaci. To solve fibonaci(n) we just need to use fibonaci(n-1) + fibonaci(n-2).

# Lecture 3 Notes
Dynamic programming can solve these two types of problems:
* Combinatoric problems: answer how many
* Optimization probelm: maximize/minimize

# Lecture 4 Notes
1. Define objective function
1. Identifying the base cases
1. Recurrence relation
1. Order of computation
1. Location of the answer
